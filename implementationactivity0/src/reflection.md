When it comes to automatic testing my program would need a way to accept an automatic input my means of already have the rainfall values in stored in the system or by randomly generating them itself. In this version of my code I had 4 different test cases. The first was a simple average calculation of 2 positive numbers. The second test included a negative number. The third was testing the double values with a decimal and finally the fourth test was no input.
